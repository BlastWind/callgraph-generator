# callgraph-generator
Generate and visualize function dependencies in Haskell, with tree-sitter's Haskell binding.

I had some experience writing call graph generators (for research). This is mostly an educational project for myself to write and use more Haskell. 

### Deliveries
Executable hackage that
- takes in path to file or directory
- outputs csv file of call edges
- or, given graph flag, output call graph visualization with graphviz
